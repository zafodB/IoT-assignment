\section{Overview of WSN layers}  \label{sec:layers}

To analyse various existing protocols, we must first learn about how a \acrlong{wsn} is built. Research suggests that while some parameters are the same as in other networks, such as Internet, other parameters are significantly different~\cite{Sohrabi2000ProtocolsNetwork}. The main limitation of the \acrshort{wsn} lies in the fact that the sensors are often battery powered and thus need to be conscious with their energy expenditure. Another implication of this is, that sensors often do not have enough computational power to calculate advanced cryptographic algorithms.

In the following section we will investigate the physical, MAC, network and transport layers, from the perspective of a WSN.
